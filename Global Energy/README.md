# Region Energy Report Power BI

The "Region Energy Report Power BI" is a comprehensive Power BI report that provides valuable insights into energy-related data for a specific region. The report includes five interactive plots, offering an in-depth analysis of key energy metrics, including CO2 emissions, total energy consumption, energy production, and the share of renewables in electricity production.

## Features

The report includes the following interactive plots:

1. **CO2 Emissions from Fossil Fuel Combustion (Line Chart):** This visualization displays trends in CO2 emissions resulting from fossil fuel combustion over time. Users can explore how emissions have changed and identify any patterns or fluctuations.

2. **Total Energy Consumption (Mtoe) in 2022 (Bar Chart):** This bar chart presents the total energy consumption in 2022, measured in million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). Users can compare energy consumption across different sectors or regions.

3. **Total Energy Production (Mtoe) in 2022 (Bar Chart):** Similar to the previous chart, this bar chart showcases the total energy production in 2022, measured in million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). Users can identify the major energy sources and their contribution to overall production.

4. **Share of Renewables in Electricity Production (%) (Pie Chart):** This interactive pie chart illustrates the proportion of renewable energy sources in electricity production. Users can click on individual slices to view specific details.
